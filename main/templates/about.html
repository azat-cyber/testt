            <p class="text_one">Django was created in the fall of 2003, when the web programmers at the Lawrence
                Journal-World newspaper, Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, began using Python to build applications.
                Jacob Kaplan-Moss was hired early in Django's development shortly before Simon Willison's internship ended.
                It was released publicly under a BSD license in July 2005. The framework was named after guitarist
                Django Reinhardt.[16] Adrian Holovaty is a Romani jazz guitar player and a big fan of Django Reinhardt.
                In June 2008, it was announced that a newly formed Django Software Foundation (DSF) would maintain Django in the future.

            <p class="text_one">Despite having its own nomenclature, such as naming the callable objects generating
                the HTTP responses "views",[7] the core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.
                It consists of an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes)
                and a relational database ("Model"), a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system
                ("View"), and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller").

                Also included in the core framework are:
                a lightweight and standalone web server for development and testing
                a form serialization and validation system that can translate between HTML forms and values suitable for storage in the database
                a template system that utilizes the concept of inheritance borrowed from object-oriented programming
                a caching framework that can use any of several cache methods
                support for middleware classes that can intervene at various stages of request processing and carry out custom functions
                an internal dispatcher system that allows components of an application to communicate events to each other via pre-defined signals
                an internationalization system, including translations of Django's own components into a variety of languages
                a serialization system that can produce and read XML and/or JSON representations of Django model instances
                a system for extending the capabilities of the template engine
                an interface to Python's built-in unit test framework
                Bundled applications
                The main Django distribution also bundles a number of applications in its "contrib" package, including:
                an extensible authentication system the dynamic administrative interface tools for generating RSS and Atom syndication feeds
                a "Sites" framework that allows one Django installation to run multiple websites, each with their own content and applications
                tools for generating Google Sitemaps built-in mitigation for cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting,
                SQL injection, password cracking and other typical web attacks, most of them turned on by default a framework for creating GIS applications
